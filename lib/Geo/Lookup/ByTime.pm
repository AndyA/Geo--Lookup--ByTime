=head1 NAME

Geo::Lookup::ByTime - Lookup location by time

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Geo::Lookup::ByTime version 0.0.3

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Geo::Lookup::ByTime;
    
    $lookup = Geo::Lookup::ByTime->new( @points );
    my $pt = $lookup->nearest( $tm );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Given a set of timestamped locations guess the location at a particular
time. This is a useful operation for, e.g., adding location information
to pictures based on their timestamp and a GPS trace that covers the
same time period.

=head1 INTERFACE 

=over

=item C<new( [ points ] )>

Create a new object optionally supplying a list of points. The points
may be supplied as an array or as a reference to an array. Each point
may be a reference to a hash containing at least the keys C<lat>, C<lon>
and C<time> or a reference to an object that supports accessor methods
called C<latitude>, C<longitude> and C<time>. 

If a coderef is supplied it is assumed to be an iterator that may be
called repeatedly to yield a set of points.

=item C<add_points( [ points ] )>

Add points. The specification for what constitutes a point is the same
as for C<new>.

=item C<nearest( $time [ , $max_dist ] )>

Return a hash indicating the estimated position at the specified time.
The returned hash has C<lat>, C<lon> and C<time> keys like this:

    my $best = {
        lat     => 54.29344,
        lon     => -2.02393,
        time    => $time
    };

Returns C<undef> if the position can't be computed. By default a
position will be calculated for any point that lies within the range of
time covered by the reference points. Optionally C<$max_dist> may
be specified in which case C<undef> will be returned if the closest
real point is more than that many metres away from the computed point.

If the requested time coincides exactly with the timestamp of one
of the points the returned point will be at the same location as
the matching point. If the time falls between the timestamps of
two points the returned point will be linearly interpolated from
those two points.

In an array context returns a list containing the synthetic point
at the specified time (i.e. the value that would be returned in
scalar context), the closest real point and the distance between
the two in metres

    my ($best, $nearest, $dist) = $lookup->nearest( $tm );

=item C<get_points()>

Return a reference to an array containing all the points in ascending
time order.

=item C<time_range()>

Return as a two element list the time range from earliest to latest of
the points in the index. Returns C<undef> if the index is empty.

=item C<hav_distance($pt, ...)>

Exportable function. Computes the Haversine distance in metres along the
line described by the points passed in. Points must be references to hashes
with keys C<lat> and C<lon>.

=back

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item C<< Point hashes must have the following keys: lat, lon, time >>

You attempted to add as a point a hash that didn't have the necessary
keys. Each point must have at least C<lat>, C<lon> and C<time>.

=item C<< Don't know how to add %s >>

Points can be added by supplying a list of objects that behave like
points (i.e. have accessors called C<latitude>, C<longitude> and
C<time>), references to hashes with the keys C<lat>, C<lon> and C<time>,
iterators that return a stream of point like objects or arrays of any of
the above. You tried to add something other than one of those.
